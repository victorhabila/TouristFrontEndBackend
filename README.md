# TouristFrontEndBackend
Project description This project aims to help tourism agencies in France by providing intelligent solutions for tourists' demands and constraints. With the vast number of sites, monuments, festivals, and museums in France, tourists often face limitations such as limited time, proximity of locations, budget constraints, and specific preferences for certain types of sites.

The goal is to assist tourism agencies in offering tailored solutions that consider these constraints. Two specific requirements are focused on: the estimated or precise period to which a site belongs and its location. This allows tourists to make choices based on the desired time period and the specific place they want to visit.

For example, tourists may want to visit as many medieval sites as possible in the "Ile de France" region during a summer week, or they may prefer to visit a maximum number of museums with minimal transportation within the Savoie department for ten days in January.
